## What is the purpose of my website?

Going out to eat or drink with friends has changed a lot with Covid, and I want to take a crack at creating a small restaurant menu app with 3 key focuses of enabling managers to add and set their menu to change dynamically using a Calendar, users can enter payment information and being adding items to their tab, and using Square, process payments for users. Ideally this would make a seamless bar/restaurant experience through a kiosk.
